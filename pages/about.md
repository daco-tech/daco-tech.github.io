# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>

In 2002 I started my career assembling, maintaining and selling computers. During that period of time, I started being a member of local Linux communities and groups, and finally had the opportunity to follow the dream of being system administrator (2004 -> 2009).

Already as a System Administrator I finished my graduation in Informatics Engineering. After that I managed consultancy projects during 6 years related with Databases, Communications, Networking, System Administration and Security in important projects and companies like: Portucel Soporcel (now Navigator Company), UniSys, DELL, GDF Suez, Adidas, Royal Canin, SBSI/SAMS, WireCo World Group, Tifosi, and others.

In 2015 I started a new project as IT Director, and managing the internal software quality assurance team. During this period, I was accepted a new project leading the newly created DataScience team developing a new software product.

In 2018 I found that what makes me happy is to have hands on technology and not only manage and meet with people. Due to this I switched to another new project as a Senior DevOps in one of the biggest Portuguese E-Commerce company.
